# Spider Linux
Linux for web developers.

All the tools from WPEmerge project will be moved into Spider Linux and will be accessible through the "slin" command, ex:

> slin install lamp-local

> slin install lamp-server

> slin install wordpress

> slin php 7 (install and enable latest php 7.x)

> slin php 5.5 (install and enable php 5.5)

> slin install spiderlinux (install various tools for webdev)

> slin make spiderlinux (creates a bootable and installable image for your current system)

> slin varnish enable/disable

> slin install node angularjs electron

> slin push (rsyncs website to registered remote server)

> slin make ssh-keys (generate new ssh keys for the current user)

> slin backup website

The objective is to be useful mainly for users of Apache, PHP, JavaScript, node.js, AngularJS, Electron, Flux/React, Laravel, Vagrant and assist the web developer in the mundane tasks of creating and tearing down websites and apps, publishing changes, testing, backing up etc.
